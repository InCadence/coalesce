Description: The pyCoalesce package itself is found in the pyCoalesce directory.  The 
        other directories contain documentation (and source for creating
        documentation), a script for generating classes from the the Coalesce entity
        XSD, tests, and build tools.
        
        The "lxml" package is recommended for manipulating XSD-based classes, but
        it's not absolutely required.
        
        Watch this space for information on installing pyCoalesce via pip.
        
        The "unit tests" are not true unit tests:  later tests rely on the entities
        created in earlier tests, thereby avoiding either repeated creation and 
        deletion of entities, or testing against a mocked-up API.  (The latter would
        be unnecessarily time-consuming to create, and wouldn't catch bugs in the API
        itself, which was still a consideration when this wrapper was created.)
