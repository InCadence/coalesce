This sub-package provides a handful of objects that don't correspond to the
Coalesce Java classes or the Coalesce RESTful API operations, but which are
necessary to make  :mod:`pyCoalesce` work.

The importable objects in this sub-package are:

    * :class:`pyCoalesce.utilities.URL_class.URL`
    * :class:`pyCoalesce.utilities.API_request.get_response`
    * :obj:`pyCoalesce.utilities.logging.package_logger`
