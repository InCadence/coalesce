You will need to use the SVCUTIL with this project.
Be sure to set the endpoints.

Primarily I used the Windows project (wDataServiceTester) over the console version, but either is fine.

Once you execute the svcutil from http://localhost:[YOURPORT]/DataService/CoalesceDataService?wsdl

BE SURE to do so from within the directory:  ...\IREMS\DataServiceTester\wDataServiceTester so the code can generate

1.) CoalescePersitor.cs
2.) output.config

The class needs to be added to the project and the information in output.config should be used to update app.config in the project.

Then open the output.config and update the endpoint address in either form1.cs or program.cs

		EndpointAddress add = new EndpointAddress("http://localhost:8080/DataService/CoalesceDataService");

Now I am returning CallResult instead of String data.  The CallResult class has been added to the DataService project and is public.
Happy Coding
